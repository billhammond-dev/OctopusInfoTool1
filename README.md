TODO:

Need to find a way to stop/kill all incoming data if thew user changes their selection? Otherwise seems data keeps coming in from old stuff

put in a stop button that kills the task get loop and also the loop for getting step history 

How to secure connection betwen front and backend?

How to know if a container is secure, i.e. has safe modules?

Figure out how to fix issue with autocomplete selection messing with background
