TODO:

Need to add some sort of reactive spinning wheel thingy for when data is being pulled, perhaps over the pulldowns when switching projects or elsewhere when pulling data

Need to find a way to stop/kill all incoming data if thew user changes their selection? Otherwise seems data keeps coming in from old stuff

How to secure connection betwen front and backend?

How to know if a container is secure, i.e. has safe modules?

Figure out how to fix issue with autocomplete selection messing with background

Need to work on displaypane, i.e. dont show first element of line, do some sort of autoTable format and coloring/etc to make it look nice
