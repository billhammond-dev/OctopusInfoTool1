How to secure connection betwen front and backend?

How to know if a container is secure, i.e. has safe modules?

ref: https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy-Api/wiki

Need to containerize/dockerize

Need to make readme useable with instructions and test/etc

Once operational with instructions need to once over and make public

Need to move Maxrecords wayy over to the right

Need to get rid of dropdown arrows and somehow have them as background images instead

Maybe dropdows can be fixed size instead and wrap text inside?? Not sure
