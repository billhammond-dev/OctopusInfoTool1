TODO:

What else besides step completion date and status are important? Maybe Release Number and Release Notes, and user who did the deployment
["Deployments-82", "0.0.6", "bill", "Deploy to portfolio-prod (#3)", null, __ob__: Observer] example line in deoployments store
Ok so stephist line needs to now have:
display component needs a top line as another prop thats sent to it
time : Version: DeployedBy: DepName: StepName :Status

Need to add some sort of reactive spinning wheel thingy for when data is being pulled, perhaps over the pulldowns when switching projects or elsewhere when pulling data

Need to find a way to stop/kill all incoming data if thew user changes their selection? Otherwise seems data keeps coming in from old stuff

Add a refresh that pulls taskList for Project and Task data again

How to secure connection betwen front and backend?

How to know if a container is secure, i.e. has safe modules?

Figure out how to fix issue with autocomplete selection messing with background

Need to work on displaypane, i.e. dont show first element of line, do some sort of autoTable format and coloring/etc to make it look nice
