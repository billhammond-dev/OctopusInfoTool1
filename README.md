TODO:
Need to add some sort of reactive spinning wheel thingy for when data is being pulled

Figure out how to fix issue with autocomplete selection messing with background

When release step selected then run query for data pane

1. When project is selected need to add a fn to also pull and store ALL project tasks (paginated!!)

1. Then when step is selected for:
  a. For each task in task ID store for given project pull entire task log and save in store list as above which will also be in historicval order anyway
  b. Display then based on selected step matching exactly data in the store

So here when you make a subtask the primary task no longer matters and only the subtask is counted.
